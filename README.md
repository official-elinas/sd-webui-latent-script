# sd-webui-latent-script

This is a script to allow generating latents on your CPU (Seeds) which generally result in improved consistency. This can be seen from ComfyUI.

An additional feature (to be added soon) is to disable the mean calculation which unbalances your weights in prompts, favoring the former prompts higher, which also leads to improved consistency.
